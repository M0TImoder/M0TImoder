## Hi there 👋

Hey there, I’m M0TImoder — a young developer from Japan. :D  
I build all sorts of things: robot control systems, games, small tools... basically anything I wish existed.  

If any of my projects help you, I’ll probably be so happy I’ll get a nosebleed. Maybe literally.  

### 🏢 organization
Part of **[@udonrobo](https://github.com/udonrobo)**. 
Scientific proof shows it's the coolest organization name in existence. Change my mind.

### 💻 Language
I write in C, C++, C#, Python, Rust, JavaScript — basically whatever language looks fun that week.  
(Skill level? Never heard of it. Sounds tasty though.)  

### 🎓 Degree
Currently studying electrical circuits and programming at a Japanese technical college (“Kosen”).  
My grades? …Please don’t ask♡  
They’ll get better once my mind calms down. Probably.♡ (wishful thinking)

### ⚡ Fun fact
Fun fact: I can move my ears.  
It’s surprisingly handy when my glasses slip out of place.  

### 😵‍💫 Current Status
Right now, I’m struggling with a pretty heavy depression, so it’s hard to stay productive.  
But once I recover, you’ll notice — because my contribution graph will explode. :)
